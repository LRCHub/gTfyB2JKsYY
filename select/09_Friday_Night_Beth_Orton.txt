I've been dreaming of Proust all in my bed
He speaks to me in my sleep
He takes me to the other side
With his madeleines and friends
When the sea comes in it's hard to believe
It'll ever go out again
Though we never do get too close
I still hold you now and then

On a Friday night
On a Friday night

There's a stillness left after you leave
It'll speak of what has been
When I'm laying in the dark awake
And I'm listening to the rain
Our sorrow made the city shine
We never had to feel that pain
Now those tears are prayers of empathy
Gonna wash me clean again

On a Friday night
On a Friday night

Forgot that we had bones
Forgot that we could feel
Forgot that we'd wake up
And it'd all be real
It'd still be real

We'd been waiting for the light to change
We'd been waiting on a friend
And the only choice that was left to us
Was to bleed or rust in the rain
Now the measure of your absence
Is the presence that you leave
And darling that's where we put all the love
That we still have to give

On a Friday night
On a Friday night

Forgot that I had bones
Forgot that I could feel
Forgot that we'd wake up
And it'd still be real
It'd still be real
