There's a stranger in my bed,
There's a pounding my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingo in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie on the barbecue
Is this a hickey or a bruise?
Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled, damn
Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
So we got kicked out of the bar
And we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois
Last Friday night
Always say we're gonna stop
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Whoa-oh-oah
This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Last, last, last, last,
Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Yeah we danced on table tops
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credits card
And go kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
